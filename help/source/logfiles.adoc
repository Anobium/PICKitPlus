== Application Log files

The PICKitPlus for PKCMD-LX, PKCMD-PI or PKCMD-PHAT create logs file that can bu used to aid issue resolution by the PICKitPlus development team.&#160;&#160;

If you are asked to provide the log files please use the following method:

1. Make the logfile and/or dumpfile visible, you must remove the leading dot from its name.

    Open a terminal and type:

    mv ~/.pkcmd-lx.log ~/pkcmd-lx.log
    mv ~/.pkcmd-lx.dump ~/pkcmd-lx.dump

2. Or, alternatively. Use cp to copy the file rather than moving (renaming).

    cp ~/.pkcmd-lx.log .pkcmd-lx.log
    cp ~/.pkcmd-lx.dump .pkcmd-lx.dump

Then, when requested by the PICKitPlus development team send these files.
