== Application Log files

The PICKitPlus products `PKCMD-LX`, `PKCMD-PI` and `PKCMD-PHAT` create log files that can be used to aid issue resolution by the PICKitPlus development team.&#160;&#160;

If you are asked to provide the log files please use the following method:

1. To make the logfile and/or dumpfile visible, you must remove the leading dot from its name.

    Open a terminal and type:

    mv ~/.pkcmd-lx.log ~/pkcmd-lx.log
    mv ~/.pkcmd-lx.dump ~/pkcmd-lx.dump

2. Or, alternatively. Use cp to copy the file rather than moving (renaming).

    cp ~/.pkcmd-lx.log .pkcmd-lx.log
    cp ~/.pkcmd-lx.dump .pkcmd-lx.dump

Then, when requested by the PICKitPlus development team, send us both of these files.
