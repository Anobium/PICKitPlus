== PKCMD-PI Introduction

The PICKitPlus for PI commandline program is called PKCMD-PI.

The program can be used for reading and writing Microchip's PIC range of microcontrollers, using the Pickit 2 or Pickit 3 device programmers.

*Program Definition*

PKCMD-PI is a 32-bit command-line interface to the PICkit 2 or PICkit 3 device programmer.

This interface is designed for programming devices in an environment where batch/script files or custom-controlled software is desired.

The PKCMD-PI executable requires the "PKPlusDeviceFile.dat" file for execution. This file should be kept in the same directory as the executable AppImage.

NOTE: To call the PKCMD-PI executable from other directories and still allow it to find the device file the device file may be explicitly specified on the command line using option -b (-B).

PKCMD-PI is a commandline-only solution.  Refer to the "PICkit 2 User's Guide" or "PICkit 3 User's Guide" for more information about the specifics of the PICkit 2/3 device Programmer.


*Device Support List*

Device support is dependent on the device file version installed
with the PKCMD-PI.  See http://www.PICKitPlus.co.uk/Typesetter/index.php/Supported-Parts[the PICKitPlus web site] for an up-to-date list of supported devices.

When selecting a part using the `-P` option (see <<_pkcmd_pi_usage, PKCMD-PI Usage>>), you can use the full name or short name.

NOTE: `-P 16f690` is the same as `-P PIC16F690`

*System Requirements*

PKCMD-PI has been tested on a number of 32-bit PI distros. It should work on all flavours, within specified limits:

1. Requires `libc` v2.13 or above. This is linked to the distribution, and is typically out of your control. If your libc version is too low, often your only recourse is to install a newer distro.
2. Requires root (or sudo), at least until it is fully installed and configured.
3. Requires `fuse` (i.e. the `fusermount` command), if you want to run PKCMD-PI without root privileges.
4. Expects `libfuse` v2.9.0 or greater, although older versions may work. For example, v2.8.5 prints warning messages but does seem to function.
5. If you have a limited or evaluation license, you will need internet access to use the program. Full licenses do not have this limitation.

*Installation*

Installation is fairly straightforward.

1. Download the .tar.gz using the link provided.
2. Unpack the .tar.gz file. It contains either a 32-bit or 64-bit AppImage, depending on the version purchased.
3. Move the AppImage, along with the provided DAT file (if present), to whatever location you wish.
   (If no DAT file is supplied, then it is not required.)
4. You may then delete the .tar.gz file and any extraneous files you do not require.
5. Ensure that the AppImage has the executable permission (using `chmod +x /path/to/appimage`)
6. Execute the AppImage with whatever parameters you desire. Use `-h` for help.

NOTE: You must be root, or use sudo.&#160;&#160;You can set up non-root access by running the program (as root) with the `--configure-no-root` instruction. This instruction takes an optional username and/or groupname argument. Examples:

   - --configure-no-root
   - --configure-no-root someuser
   - --configure-no-root someuser:somegroup
   - --configure-no-root :somegroup

If in doubt, simply give it your username (to give you access) or the `:users` group (to give all users access).

*AppImage*

PKCMD-PI is distributed as an AppImage.&#160;&#160;
Using an AppImage enables the development team to provide native binaries for PI users the same way we do for other operating systems.&#160;&#160;
An AppImage enables the development team to package the PKCMD-PI application for the PI operating systems.&#160;&#160;

The PICKitPlus AppImage comes with all dependencies that cannot be assumed to be part of each target system in a recent enough version and will run on most PI distributions without further modifications.&#160;&#160;

Almost all major distributions are compatible with AppImages, without requiring the user to make modifications to the base system.&#160;&#160;
AppImages are portable. You can place the AppImage on a USB flash drive and run it from there, on any machine, if you wish.&#160;&#160;

To summarise:&#160;&#160;AppImages provide an easy and unified user experience that is simple to install and use.
